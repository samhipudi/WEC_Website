# This is the example structure of what your .env file should look like.
#
# DO NOT MODIFY this file - this is published as part of your Git repository.
# Instead, create a new file at the root of your project called `.env`, paste
# the contents of this file into `.env`, and change the environment variables
# to match configuration from Supabase.
#
# Note that environment variables prefixed by `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are ultimately
# shipped as part of the client application JS bundle the browser recieves.
# Since `DATABASE_URL` does not have this prefix, this environment variable is
# only accessible by the server. Attempting to access its value from the client
# side will result in an error, protecting our sensitive database URL.
