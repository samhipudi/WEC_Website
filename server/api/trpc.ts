/**
 * This setup code defines the tRPC context and procedure stems used by the API.
 *
 * First, each tRPC route is provided context, including:
 * - **subject**: The subject refers to the currently authenticated user, verified
 *   by Supabase auth.
 *
 * Then, two procedure steps are defined:
 * - **publicProcedure**: Standard API routes can be defined using the public procedure stem.
 *   With this procedure, the user does not have to be authenticated.
 * - **protectedProcedure**: Protected API routes, which should be usable only by signed-in users,
 *   can be defined using the protected procedure stem. With this procedure, the user must be
 *   authenticated or else an `unauthorized` error will be thrown. The authenticated user is also
 *   provided to the procedure as context.
